# Problem Statement

Coffee enthusiasts often face difficulty in finding authentic, high-quality coffee shops that cater to their preferences. Existing platforms usually provide extensive lists of reviews without personalized recommendations based on individual taste and ambiance preferences. This project aims to address the gap by creating a focused web application that lets users discover, review, and receive tailored recommendations for coffee shops. The application will combine user reviews with detailed coffee shop profiles to offer personalized suggestions and improve the overall customer experience.
