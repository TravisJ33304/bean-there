Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to alcohol, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my coffee within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my coffee, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the vibe may be. Any ideas? ",

         " 11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in food seating I loved the eclectic and homey plush vibe and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make food so we headed out in search of food and foods.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seating and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold coffee coffee, food and foods and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The food and foods wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the food was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be vibe and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. food and foods Pop tart Coffee See all photos from parkingmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul ",

No WiFi vibe is a bit loud and the mix is odd.  Pleasant French oldies followed by loud techno. Several seatings were dirty when we got there. Service is average.

I loved their computerized user friendly ordering system, it made it easy me to pick & choose all the items I wanted to try. I ordered pop tart, food & foods, strawberry foods (photos uploaded). This place is ideal for ordering a few dishes to share with your group. seatinging is limited since this place is fairly new with lots of visitors.

I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to alcohol, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my coffee within minutes!

I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make food so we headed out in search of food and foods.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seating and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold coffee coffee, food and foods and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The food and foods wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the food was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be vibe and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. food and foods Pop tart Coffee See all photos from parkingmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul",

I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to alcohol, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my coffee within minutes!

I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make food so we headed out in search of food and foods.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seating and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold coffee coffee, food and foods and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The food and foods wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the food was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be vibe and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. food and foods Pop tart Coffee See all photos from parkingmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul\", 'num_rating': 4.0}\n",

Just about everything is bad price. $1.50 extra for 3 ounces of Almond Milk in a coffee. No WiFi vibe is a bit loud and the mix is odd.  Pleasant French oldies followed by loud techno.
